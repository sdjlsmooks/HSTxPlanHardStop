Hard stop would occur on select "Type of Service"
  At that point, look at treatment plan end date.  

  if most recent treatment plan.end date < current date
      hard stop

  if most recent treatment plan.end_date >= date_of_service
     if (treatment plan status != final)
           hard stop

OR
   
   if treatment plan end date >= date_of_service  
         hard stop
 

Only for specific services (get from Matt, probably in the SQL code)
